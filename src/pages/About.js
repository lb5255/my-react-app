            Hello! My name is Lea, and I‚Äôm a <mark>software engineer</mark>. 
    
     I‚Äôm always eager to learn new tools to enhance my development skills. Currently, I‚Äôm working toward my <mark>AWS Developer</mark> certification to deepen my knowledge of cloud computing and infrastructure.
    
     My journey in tech began in high school with the <mark>Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</mark>, where I was first introduced to Python and JavaScript. I quickly fell in love with coding and knew I wanted to turn it into my career! üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

                I graduated cum laude from Rochester Institute of Technology with a <mark>Bachelor of Science in Web & Mobile Computing</mark>. In addition to my tech studies, I earned an <mark>Associate of Arts</mark> degree from Bard College while attending Bard High School Early College in Manhattan.

                Alongside my studies, I served as a <mark>Resident Advisor</mark> for three years, receiving bi-annual training to support residential students as a first-line responder for crisis management, mental health needs, resource referrals, and community engagement.
    
    I was also an active member of <mark>Women in Computing</mark>, participating in club events such as WiCHacks‚Äîa 72-hour hackathon where participants collaborate to develop apps, websites, games, or other software projects.
